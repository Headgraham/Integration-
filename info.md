# [Wyze Integration for Home Assistant](https://github.com/JoshuaMulliken/ha-wyzeapi) for Home Assistant

This is a custom component to allow control of various Wyze devices in Home Assistant using the unofficial API. Please
note this mimics the Wyze app and therefore access may be cut off at anytime.

### Highlights of what **WyzeApi** can do

* Control all types of Wyze Bulbs as lights through HA
* Control all types of Wyze Plugs as switches through HA
